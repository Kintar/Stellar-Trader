# Entity System

## Form
* Form objects are renderable items that represent the way a game token looks in the UI.  They may contain space, state and action
objects to modify the way they render.

## State
* State objects are data, pure and simple.  They are "game state at this point in time".

## Space
* A space object represents a set of Entities associated with one another.
* Each entity object contains a space object that defines its scope of effect.
* A game will typically contain two top-level space objects; logical space (the top level entities in the world) and virtual space (the entities currently being rendered to the UI)

## Action
* Actions invoke over a perod of time, or until cancelled by changes in state. They are "game state changes over time".
* Actions have a source, or user, entity, and either a target entity or a target set.  (Maybe always a set, but potentially a 
set of one?)
* Actions are assigned to an entity in two sets: Possible and Current.

## Entity
* Entities are collections of Actions, States, Spaces and Forms.  An entity represents a logical game unit, such as a bullet, a 
ship's inventory, or a solar system.
